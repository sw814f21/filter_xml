## Smiley data

Only companies with a p-number is included.

Start date and *actual* industry code (f√∏devarestyrelsen's data is scuffed) is scraped from virk.dk.
Only industry codes `561010, 561020, 563000` are included (restaurants | pizzarias, ice cream, etc | cafes, pubs, etc).

A company may not exist anymore - this can possibly be handled by excluding companies that have not received smiley control within the last year.
